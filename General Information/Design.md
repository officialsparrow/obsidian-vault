## Workspaces
There are different workspaces.
You have 1 workspace by default. 
This workspace is for DM and group chats.

Every workspace can have his own color scheme. 
You can select 1 workspace as the default workspace, that will automatically open when you open the app.

Servers are in a separate workspace.
You can add more workspaces for work.
A member of work-workspace has access to maximum 2 servers, and normal DM chats.
